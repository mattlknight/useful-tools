# First install gpg2 if it isn't already installed
sudo apt install gnupg2

# if you are doing this for git, be sure git is installed
sudo apt install git

# Before moving on, double check that you are currently logged in as the normal user you want to be using, and not root or another account

# Edit your .bashrc or .bash_profile to support gpg v2, copy from between START/END
# <<<<<START
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
# >>>> END

# !!! Notice, you must log out and log back in to restart gpg2, so you can generate the key

# Next generate a gpg key, if for github, use fullname and email that matches github account
gpg2 --gen-key

# Verify the key was created
gpg2 --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

# Export the key to pub format for github copy/paste into account
gpg2 --armor --export HEXLONGKEYFROMLISTKEYS

# Copy and paste gpg block into github if needed

# Configure git for gpg2 and github account
